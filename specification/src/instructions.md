# Instructions

Most instructions are contained within a single, parameterless machine word.

Some instructions take a machine word as argument and are so considered double-word instructions.
They are recognized by the form ‚Äú`instr` + `arg`‚Äù.

## Regarding Opcodes

An instruction's _[operation code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opcode)_, or _opcode_, is the machine word uniquely identifying the instruction.
For reasons of efficient [arithmetization](arithmetization.md), certain properties of the instruction are encoded in the opcode.
Concretely:
- all double-word instructions have an odd opcode, _i.e._, the least significant bit is 1.
- all instructions shrinking the operational stack are 2 mod 4, _i.e._, the second-to-least significant bit is 1.

The former property is used by instruction [skiz](instruction-specific-transition-constraints.md#instruction-skiz).
The latter property helps guarantee that operational stack underflow cannot happen.
It is used by several instructions through instruction group [`stack_shrinks_and_top_3_unconstrained`](instruction-groups.md#group-stack_shrinks_and_top_3_unconstrained).

## OpStack Manipulation

| Instruction  | Opcode | old OpStack         | new OpStack           | Description                                                                      |
|:-------------|-------:|:--------------------|:----------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `pop`        |      2 | `_ a`               | `_`                   | Pops top element from stack.                                                     |
| `push` + `a` |      1 | `_`                 | `_ a`                 | Pushes `a` onto the stack.                                                       |
| `divine`     |      4 | `_`                 | `_ a`                 | Pushes a non-deterministic element `a` to the stack. Interface for secret input. |
| `dup`  + `i` |      5 | e.g., `_ e d c b a` | e.g., `_ e d c b a d` | Duplicates the element `i` positions away from the top, assuming `0 <= i < 16`.  |
| `swap` + `i` |      9 | e.g., `_ e d c b a` | e.g., `_ e a c b d`   | Swaps the `i`th stack element with the top of the stack, assuming `0 < i < 16`.  |

Instruction `divine` (together with [`divine_sibling`](#hashing)) make TritonVM a virtual machine that can execute non-deterministic programs.
As programs go, this concept is somewhat unusual and benefits from additional explanation.
The name of the instruction is the verb (not the adjective) meaning ‚Äúto discover by intuition or insight.‚Äù

From the perspective of the program, the instruction `divine` makes some element `a` magically appear on the stack.
It is not at all specified what `a` is, but generally speaking, `a` has to be exactly correct, else execution fails.
Hence, from the perspective of the program, it just non-deterministically guesses the correct value of `a` in a moment of divine clarity.

Looking at the entire system, consisting of the VM, the program, and all inputs ‚Äì both public and secret ‚Äì execution _is_ deterministic:
the value `a` was supplied as a secret input.

## Memory Access

| Instruction | Opcode | old OpStack | new OpStack | old `ramv` | new `ramv` | Description                                                                             |
|:------------|-------:|:------------|:------------|:-----------|:-----------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `read_mem`  |     20 | `_ p a`     | `_ p v`     | `v`        | `v`        | Reads value `v` from RAM at address `p` and overwrites the top of the OpStack with `v`. |

## Hashing

| Instruction      | Opcode | old OpStack     | new OpStack                   | Description                                                                                             |
|:-----------------|-------:|:----------------|:------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `hash`           |     28 | `_jihgfedcba`   | `_yxwvu00000`                 | Overwrites the stack's 10 top-most elements with their hash digest (length 5) and 5 zeros.              |
| `divine_sibling` |     32 | `_ i*****edcba` | e.g., `_ (i div 2)edcbazyxwv` | Helps traversing a Merkle tree during authentication path verification. See extended description below. |
| `assert_vector`  |     36 | `_`             | `_`                           | Assert equality of `st(i)` to `st(i+5)` for `0 <= i < 4`. Crashes the VM if any pair is unequal.        |

The instruction `hash` works as follows.
The stack's 10 top-most elements (`jihgfedcba`) are reversed and concatenated with six zeros, resulting in `abcdefghij000000`.
The permutation `xlix` is applied to `abcdefghij000000`, resulting in `Œ±Œ≤Œ≥Œ¥ŒµŒ∂Œ∑Œ∏ŒπŒ∫uvwxyz`.
The first five elements of this result, i.e., `Œ±Œ≤Œ≥Œ¥Œµ`, are reversed and written to the stack, overwriting `st5` through `st9`.
The top elements of the stack `st0` through `st4` are set to zero.
For example, the old stack was `_ jihgfedcba` and the new stack is `_ ŒµŒ¥Œ≥Œ≤Œ± 00000`.

The instruction `divine_sibling` works as follows.
The 11th element of the stack `i` is taken as the node index for a Merkle tree that is claimed to include data whose digest is the content of stack registers `st0` through `st4`, i.e., `edcba`.
The sibling digest of `edcba` is `zyxwv` and is read from the input interface of secret data.
The least-significant bit of `i` indicates whether `edcba` is the digest of a left leaf or a right leaf of the Merkle tree's base level.
Depending on this least significant bit of `i`, `divine_sibling` either
1. does not change registers `st0` through `st4` and moves `zyxwv` into registers `st5` through `st9`, or
2. moves `edcba` into registers `st5` through `st9` and moves `zyxwv` into registers `st0` through `st4`.
The 11th element of the operational stack is modified by shifting `i` by 1 bit to the right, i.e., dropping the least-significant bit.
In conjunction with instruction `hash` and `assert_vector`, the instruction `divine_sibling` allows to efficiently verify a Merkle authentication path.
