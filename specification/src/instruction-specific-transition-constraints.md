## Instruction `nop`

This instruction uses all constraints defined by [instruction groups](instruction-groups.md) `step_1`, `keep_stack`, and `keep_ram`.
It has no additional transition constraints.

## Instruction `skiz`

For the correct behavior of instruction `skiz`, the instruction pointer `ip` needs to increment by either 1, or 2, or 3.
The concrete value depends on the top of the stack `st0` and the next instruction, held in `nia`.

Efficient arithmetization of instruction `skiz` makes use of one of the properties of [opcodes](instructions.md#regarding-opcodes).
Concretely, the least significant bit of an opcode is 1 if and only if the instruction takes an argument.
The arithmetization of `skiz` can incorporate this simple flag by decomposing `nia` into helper variable registers `hv`,
similarly to how `ci` is (always) deconstructed into instruction bit registers `ib`.

This instruction uses all constraints defined by [instruction groups](instruction-groups.md) `keep_jump_stack`, `shrink_stack`, and `keep_ram`.
Additionally, it defines the following transition constraints.

### Description

1. The jump stack pointer `jsp` does not change.
1. The last jump's origin `jso` does not change.
1. The last jump's destination `jsd` does not change.
1. The next instruction `nia` is decomposed into helper variables `hv`.
1. The relevant helper variable `hv1` is either 0 or 1.
    Here, `hv1 == 1` means that `nia` takes an argument.
1. If `st0` is non-zero, register `ip` is incremented by 1.
If `st0` is 0 and `nia` takes no argument, register `ip` is incremented by 2.
If `st0` is 0 and `nia` takes an argument, register `ip` is incremented by 3.

Written as Disjunctive Normal Form, the last constraint can be expressed as:
6. (Register `st0` is 0 or `ip` is incremented by 1), and
(`st0` has a multiplicative inverse or `hv0` is 1 or `ip` is incremented by 2), and
(`st0` has a multiplicative inverse or `hv0` is 0 or `ip` is incremented by 3).

Since the three cases are mutually exclusive, the three respective polynomials can be summed up into one.

### Polynomials

1. `jsp' - jsp`
1. `jso' - jso`
1. `jsd' - jsd`
1. `nia - (hv0 + 4·hv1 + 8·hv2)`

1. `(ip' - (ip + 1)·st0) + ((ip' - (ip + 2))·(st0·hv2 - 1)·(hv0 - 1)) + ((ip' - (ip + 3))·(st0·hv2 - 1)·hv0)`

### Helper variable definitions for `skiz`

Note:
The concrete decomposition of `nia` into helper variables `hv` as well as the concretely relevant `hv` determining whether `nia` takes an argument (currently `hv0`) are subject to change.

1. `hv0 = nia % 2`
1. `hv1 = nia / 2`
1. `hv2 = inverse(st0)` (if `st0 ≠ 0`)
