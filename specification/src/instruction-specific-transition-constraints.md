## Instruction `nop`

This instruction is fully constrained by its [instruction groups](instruction-groups.md)

## Instruction `skiz`

For the correct behavior of instruction `skiz`, the instruction pointer `ip` needs to increment by either 1, or 2, or 3.
The concrete value depends on the top of the stack `st0` and the next instruction, held in `nia`.

Helper variable `hv0` helps with identifying whether `st0` is 0.
To this end, it holds the inverse-or-zero of `st0`, _i.e._, is 0 if and only if `st0` is 0, and is the inverse of `st0` otherwise.

Efficient arithmetization of instruction `skiz` makes use of one of the properties of [opcodes](instructions.md#regarding-opcodes).
Concretely, the least significant bit of an opcode is 1 if and only if the instruction takes an argument.
The arithmetization of `skiz` can incorporate this simple flag by decomposing `nia` into helper variable registers `hv`,
similarly to how `ci` is (always) deconstructed into instruction bit registers `ib`.
Correct decomposition is guaranteed by employing a [range check](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounds_checking).

In addition to its [instruction groups](instruction-groups.md), this instruction has the following constraints.

### Description

1. Helper variable `hv1` is the inverse of `st0` or 0.
1. Helper variable `hv1` is the inverse of `st0` or `st0` is 0.
1. The next instruction `nia` is decomposed into helper variables `hv1` through `hv5`.
1. The indicator helper variable `hv1` is either 0 or 1.
    Here, `hv1 == 1` means that `nia` takes an argument.
1. The helper variable `hv2` is either 0 or 1 or 2 or 3.
1. The helper variable `hv3` is either 0 or 1 or 2 or 3.
1. The helper variable `hv4` is either 0 or 1 or 2 or 3.
1. The helper variable `hv5` is either 0 or 1 or 2 or 3.
1. If `st0` is non-zero, register `ip` is incremented by 1.
If `st0` is 0 and `nia` takes no argument, register `ip` is incremented by 2.
If `st0` is 0 and `nia` takes an argument, register `ip` is incremented by 3.

Written as Disjunctive Normal Form, the last constraint can be expressed as:

10. (Register `st0` is 0 or `ip` is incremented by 1), and
(`st0` has a multiplicative inverse or `hv1` is 1 or `ip` is incremented by 2), and
(`st0` has a multiplicative inverse or `hv1` is 0 or `ip` is incremented by 3).

Since the three cases are mutually exclusive, the three respective polynomials can be summed up into one.

### Polynomials

1. `(st0·hv0 - 1)·hv0`
1. `(st0·hv0 - 1)·st0`
1. `nia - hv1 - 2·hv2 - 8·hv3 - 32·hv4 - 128·hv5`
1. `hv1·(hv1 - 1)`
1. `hv2·(hv2 - 1)·(hv2 - 2)·(hv2 - 3)`
1. `hv3·(hv3 - 1)·(hv3 - 2)·(hv3 - 3)`
1. `hv4·(hv4 - 1)·(hv4 - 2)·(hv4 - 3)`
1. `hv5·(hv5 - 1)·(hv5 - 2)·(hv5 - 3)`
1. `(ip' - (ip + 1)·st0)`<br />
    ` + ((ip' - (ip + 2))·(st0·hv0 - 1)·(hv1 - 1))`<br />
    ` + ((ip' - (ip + 3))·(st0·hv0 - 1)·hv1)`

### Helper variable definitions for `skiz`

1. `hv0 = inverse(st0)` (if `st0 ≠ 0`)
1. `hv1 = nia mod 2`
1. `hv2 = (nia >> 1) mod 4`
1. `hv3 = (nia >> 3) mod 4`
1. `hv4 = (nia >> 5) mod 4`
1. `hv5 = nia >> 7`

## Instruction `call` + `d`

In addition to its [instruction groups](instruction-groups.md), this instruction has the following constraints.

### Description

1. The jump's origin `jso` is set to the current instruction pointer `ip` plus 2.
1. The jump's destination `jsd` is set to the instruction's argument `d`.

1. `ip' - nia`

1. `ip' - jso`

## Instruction `recurse`

1. The last jump's destination `jsd` does not change.
1. The instruction pointer `ip` is set to the last jump's destination `jsd`.

### Polynomials

1. `jso' - jso`
1. `jsd' - jsd`
1. `ip' - jsd`

## Instruction `recurse_or_return` + `i`

In addition to its [instruction groups](instruction-groups.md), this instruction has the following constraints.

### Description

Let `lhs` the stack element indicated by `i` in the current row.
Let `rhs` the successor of the stack element indicated by `i`, _i.e._, the stack element at index `i + 1 mod 16`, also in the current row.

For `j` ∈ [0, …, 15]:

1. If `i` equals `j`, and if `lhs` equals `rhs`, then `hv4` in the current row is 0.
1. If `i` equals `j`, and if `lhs` equals `rhs`, then the difference of `rhs` and `lhs` is 0.
1. If `i` equals `j`, and if `lhs` equals `rhs`, then `ip` in the next row equals `jso` in the current row.
1. If `i` equals `j`, and if `lhs` equals `rhs`, then `jsp` decrements by one.<br><br>
1. If `i` equals `j` and if `lhs` unequal `rhs`, then `ip` in the next row is equal to `jsd` in the current row.
1. If `i` equals `j` and if `lhs` unequal `rhs`, then `jsp` remains unchanged.
1. If `i` equals `j` and if `lhs` unequal `rhs`, then `jso` remains unchanged.
1. If `i` equals `j` and if `lhs` unequal `rhs`, then `jsd` remains unchanged.

Note that constraints 1 through 4 and constraints 5 through 8 are mutually exclusive.
Consequently, it is possible to build pairwise sums (e.g., constraint 1 plus constraint 5, constraint 2 plus constraint 6, and so on) without changing completeness or soundness.
Due to the nature of [indicator polynomials](instruction-groups.md#indicator-polynomials-ind_ihv3-hv2-hv1-hv0), the same is true for the various `j`.
As a result, instruction `recurse_or_return` defines a total of 4 constraints, each of which consists of 2·16 summands.

## Instruction `merkle_step`

Recall that in a Merkle tree, the indices of left (respectively right) leaves have 0 (respectively 1) as their least significant bit.
This motivates the use of a helper variable to hold that least significant bit.

In addition to its [instruction groups](instruction-groups.md), this instruction has the following constraints.
The two [Evaluation Arguments also used for instruction hash](processor-table.md#transition-constraints) guarantee correct transition of the top of the stack.

### Description

1. Helper variable `hv5` is either 0 or 1.
1. `st5` is shifted by 1 bit to the right. In other words, twice `st5` in the next row plus `hv5` equals `st5` in the current row.

### Helper variable definitions for `merkle_step`

1. `hv0` through `hv4` hold the sibling digest of the node indicated by `st5`, as read from the interface for non-deterministic input.
1. `hv5` holds the result of `st5 % 2`, the Merkle tree node index's least significant bit, indicating whether it is a left or right node.

## Instruction `xx_dot_step`

1. Add `(hv0 + hv1·x + hv2·x²) · (hv3 + hv4·x + hv5·x²)` into `(st2, st3, st4)`
1. Increase the pointers: `st0` and `st1` by 3 each.

## Instruction `xb_dot_step`

In addition to its [instruction groups](instruction-groups.md), this instruction has the following constraints.

1. Store `RAM[st0]` in `hv0`.
1. Store `(RAM[st1], RAM[st1+1], RAM[st1+2])` in `(hv1, hv2, hv3)`.
1. Add `hv0 · (hv1 + hv2·x + hv3·x²)` into `(st1, st2, st3)`
1. Increase the pointers: `st0` and `st1` by 1 and 3, respectively.
