# Operational Stack Table

The operational stack is where the program stores simple elementary operations, function arguments, and pointers to important objects.
There are 16 registers (`st0` through `st15`) that the program can access directly.
These registers correspond to the top of the stack.
The rest of the operational stack is stored in a dedicated memory object called Operational Stack Underflow Memory.
It is initially empty.

The operational stack table contains a subset of the columns of the processor table ‚Äì
specifically, the cycle counter `clk`, the current instruction `ci`, the operation stack value `osv` and pointer `osp`.
The rows of the operational stack table are sorted by operational stack pointer `osp` first, cycle count `clk` second.

The mechanics are best illustrated by an example.
Observe how the malicious manipulation of the OpStack Underflow Memory, the change of ‚Äú42‚Äù into ‚Äú99‚Äù in cycle 8, is detected:
The transition constraints of the OpStack Table stipulate that if `osp` does not change, then `osv` can only change if current instruction `ci` shrinks the OpStack.
Instruction `push` does _not_ shrink the OpStack.
Consequently, row `[5, push, 9, 42]` being followed by row `[_, _, 9, 99]` violates the constraints.

For illustrative purposes only, we use four stack registers `st0` through `st3` in the example.
TritonVM has 16 stack registers, `st0` through `st15`.

## Padding

A padding row is a direct copy of the Op Stack Table's row with the highest value for column `clk`, called template row, with the exception of the cycle count column `clk`.
In a padding row, the value of column `clk` is 1 greater than the value of column `clk` in the template row.
The padding row is inserted right below the template row.
These steps are repeated until the desired padded height is reached.
In total, above steps ensure that the Permutation Argument between the Op Stack Table and the [Processor Table](processor-table.md) holds up.

## Initial Constraints

1. `clk` is 0
1. `osv` is 0.
1. `osp` is the number of available stack registers, i.e., 16.

**Initial Constraints as Polynomials**

1. `clk`
1. `osv`
1. `osp - 16`

## Consistency Constraints

None.

## Transition Constraints

1. the `osp` increases by 1, *or*
1. the `osp` does not change AND the `osv` does not change, *or*
1. the `osp` does not change AND the `ci` shrinks the OpStack.

Written as Disjunctive Normal Form, the same constraints can be expressed as:
1. the `osp` increases by 1 or the `osp` does not change
1. the `osp` increases by 1 or the `osv` does not change or the `ci` shrinks the OpStack

An instruction is OpStack-shrinking if it is
- in instruction group `shrink_stack`, or
- in instruction group `binop`, or
- `xbmul`.

**Transition Constraints as Polynomials**

1. `(osp' - (osp + 1))¬∑(osp' - osp)`
1. `(osp' - (osp + 1))¬∑(osv' - osv)¬∑(ci - op_code(pop))¬∑(ci - op_code(skiz))¬∑(ci - op_code(assert))¬∑(ci - op_code(add))¬∑(ci - op_code(mul))¬∑(ci - op_code(eq))¬∑(ci - op_code(lt))¬∑(ci - op_code(and))¬∑(ci - op_code(xor))¬∑(ci - op_code(xbmul))¬∑(ci - op_code(write_io))`

## Terminal Constraints

None.

## Relations to Other Tables

1. A Permutation Argument establishes that the rows of the operational stack table correspond to the rows of the [Processor Table](processor-table.md).
