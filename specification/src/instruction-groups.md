# Instruction Groups

Some transition constraints are shared across some, or even many instructions.
For example, most instructions must not change the jump stack.
Likewise, most instructions must not change RAM.
To simplify presentation of the instruction-specific transition constraints, these common constraints are grouped together and aliased.
Continuing above example, instruction group `keep_jump_stack` contains all transition constraints to ensure that the jump stack remains unchanged.

The next section treats each instruction group in detail.
The following table lists and briefly explains all instruction groups.

## Indicator Polynomials `ind_i(hv3, hv2, hv1, hv0)`

In this and the following sections, a register marked with a `'` refers to the next state of that register.
For example, `st0' = st0 + 2` means that stack register `st0` is incremented by 2.
An alternative view for the same concept is that registers marked with `'` are those of the next row in the table.

For instructions [`dup`](instruction-specific-transition-constraints.md#instruction-dup--i) and [`swap`](instruction-specific-transition-constraints.md#instruction-swap--i), it is beneficial to have polynomials that evaluate to 1 if the instruction's argument `i` is a specific value, and to 0 otherwise.
This allows indicating which registers are constraint, and in which way they are, depending on `i`.
This is the purpose of the _indicator polynomials_ `ind_i`.
Evaluated on the binary decomposition of `i`, they show the behavior described above.

For example, take `i = 13`.
The corresponding binary decomposition is `(hv3, hv2, hv1, hv0) = (1, 1, 0, 1)`.
Indicator polynomial `ind_13(hv3, hv2, hv1, hv0)` is `hv3·hv2·(1 - hv1)·hv0`.
It evaluates to 1 on `(1, 1, 0, 1)`, i.e., `ind_13(1, 1, 0, 1) = 1`.
Any other indicator polynomial, like `ind_7`, evaluates to 0 on `(1, 1, 0, 1)`.
Likewise, the indicator polynomial for 13 evaluates to 0 for any other argument.

Below, you can find a list of all 16 indicator polynomials.
