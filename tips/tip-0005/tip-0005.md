**Abstract.**
This note proposes a new arithmetization-oriented hash function. It uses the SHARK design strategy [1] in combination with lookup tables, and is defined over the field with $p=2^{64}-2^{32}+1$ elements. This note also discusses techniques for efficiently arithmetizing the hash function.

## Introduction

In the space of arithmetization-oriented hash function, two design strategies stand out.

 1. The Marvellous design strategy [2], best known for its member Rescue-Prime [3], introduced the idea of alternating S-box layers where even layers compute low-degree permutations in one direction and odd layers compute low-degree permutations in the opposite direction. As a result, a small number of rounds guarantees that the algebraic degree of the cipher is sufficiently high when attacked from any direction. Moreover, in the specific case of Rescue-Prime, two consecutive S-box layers can be folded together into one low-degree arithmetization. This folding technique yields essentially two rounds of the cipher for the price of one cycle in the arithmetic virtual machine. Since the publication of the Marvellous design strategy, there has been very little progress in cryptanalyzing Rescue and Rescue-Prime.

 2. Reinforced Concrete [4] introduced the use of lookup tables in an otherwise arithmetization-oriented cipher. The lookup table can be evaluated efficiently on CPUs as well as proven efficiently in a zero-knowledge or succinctly verifiable proof system using Plookup [5] or techniques derived from there. Moreover, represented as polynomials over a finite field, non-trivial lookup tables have maximal degree. Therefore, the use of lookup tables provides a robust way to resist algebraic attacks including attacks relying on Gröbner bases. The downside of this technique is that the lookup tables cannot be too large; that therefore the field elements must be decomposed into chunks which are then looked up; and that the prover must establish the correct decomposition and recomposition of these chunks. This process leads to an expensive arithmetization and does not generalize well to arbitrary fields.

This note proposes a new hash function. It uses the SHARK design strategy, on which Marvellous is based, of using full S-box layers interleaved with MDS matrices. This strategy ensures resistance against statistical attacks. The S-box is built from a table lookup that computes the square in $\mathbb{F}_{2^{16}}$. In addition to being fast to compute, this function makes the algebraic degree large and provides resistance against Gröbner basis attacks. This note also includes a discussion about how to avoid paying high costs when arithmetizing the hash function in a STARK.

## Specification

### Basic Parameters 

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| field modulus $p$ | $2^{64} - 2^{32} + 1$ |
| number of rounds $N$ | 7 |
| state size $m$ | 16 |
| sponge rate $r$ | 10 |
| sponge capacity $c$ | 6 |
| digest length $d$ | 5 |

### S-Box

The S-box is defined as follows:

$$ S : \mathbb{F}_p \rightarrow \mathbb{F}_p,  x \mapsto \rho \circ \mu \circ L^4 \circ \mu \circ \sigma  (x) $$

The components are:

 - $\sigma : \mathbb{F}_p \rightarrow \mathbb{F}_p^4, x \mapsto (a, b, c, d)$ where all four outputs are at most 16 bits wide and $x = a + 2^{16} \cdot b + 2^{32} \cdot c + 2^{48} \cdot d$.
 - $\mu : \mathbb{F}_p^4 \rightarrow \mathbb{F}_p^4, (a, b, c, d) \mapsto (a, b, 2^{16}-1 - c, 2^{16}-1 - d)$.
 - $L : \mathbb{F}_ p \rightarrow \mathbb{F}_ p$ is defined only for field elements that are at most 16 bits wide. Identifying this subset of $\mathbb{F}_ p$ with $\mathbb{F}_ {2^{16}} = \mathbb{F}_ {2}[X] / \langle X^{16} + X^5 + X^3 + X^2 + 1 \rangle$ via the Kronecker substitution $\mathbb{F}_ {2^{16}} \ni f(X) \leftrightarrow f(2) \in \mathbb{F}_ p$, the lookup table $L$ computes $L : \mathbb{F}_ {2^{16}} \rightarrow \mathbb{F}_ {2^{16}}, x \mapsto x^2$.
 - $\rho : \mathbb{F}_ p^4 \rightarrow \mathbb{F}_ p$ computes the inverse of $\sigma$.

The inverse of this S-box is $\rho \circ \mu \circ (L^{-1})^4 \circ \mu \circ \sigma$.

Two input-output pairs are noteworthy: $S(0) = 0$ and $S(-1) = -1$.

### Remaining Specifications

A single round consists of three steps:

 1. A full S-box layer, in which the function $S(x)$ is applied to every element of the state.
 2. Matrix-vector multiplication of the MDS matrix with the state (as the column vector). The MDS matrix is the one given by the Rescue-Prime Optimized report, namely the circulant matrix whose first row is `[256, 2, 1073741824, 2048, 16777216, 128, 8, 16, 524288, 4194304, 1, 268435456, 1, 1024, 2, 8192]`.
 3. Addition of constants. A preselected random constant is added into every element of the state.

The constants are determined by expanding the ASCII string "`TIP 5`" into $9 m N$ bytes using SHAKE256. Every 9-tuple corresponds to a positive integer by interpreting the first byte as the most significant digit in base 256. Every such integer determines a field element via reduction modulo $p$. The $(mi + j)$ th field element is the constant for the $j$ th state element in the $i$ th round.

The permutation $P$ consists of $N = 7$ rounds. The hash function is obtained by instantiating the sponge construction with the permutation $P$ and truncating the output to length $d = 5$.
