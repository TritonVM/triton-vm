**Abstract.**
This note proposes a new arithmetization-oriented hash function. It uses the SHARK design strategy [1] in combination with lookup tables, and is defined over the field with $p=2^{64}-2^{32}+1$ elements. This note also discusses techniques for efficiently arithmetizing the hash function.

## Introduction

In the space of arithmetization-oriented hash function, two design strategies stand out.

 1. The Marvellous design strategy [2], best known for its member Rescue-Prime [3], introduced the idea of alternating S-box layers where even layers compute low-degree permutations in one direction and odd layers compute low-degree permutations in the opposite direction. As a result, a small number of rounds guarantees that the algebraic degree of the cipher is sufficiently high when attacked from any direction. Moreover, in the specific case of Rescue-Prime, two consecutive S-box layers can be folded together into one low-degree arithmetization. This folding technique yields essentially two rounds of the cipher for the price of one cycle in the arithmetic virtual machine. Since the publication of the Marvellous design strategy, there has been very little progress in cryptanalyzing Rescue and Rescue-Prime.

 2. Reinforced Concrete [4] introduced the use of lookup tables in an otherwise arithmetization-oriented cipher. The lookup table can be evaluated efficiently on CPUs as well as proven efficiently in a zero-knowledge or succinctly verifiable proof system using Plookup [5] or techniques derived from there. Moreover, represented as polynomials over a finite field, non-trivial lookup tables have maximal degree. Therefore, the use of lookup tables provides a robust way to resist algebraic attacks including attacks relying on Gröbner bases. The downside of this technique is that the lookup tables cannot be too large; that therefore the field elements must be decomposed into chunks which are then looked up; and that the prover must establish the correct decomposition and recomposition of these chunks. This process leads to an expensive arithmetization and does not generalize well to arbitrary fields.

This note proposes a new hash function. It uses the SHARK design strategy, on which Marvellous is based, of using full S-box layers interleaved with MDS matrices. This strategy ensures resistance against statistical attacks. The S-box is built from a table lookup that computes the cube map in $\mathbb{F}_{2^{16}+1}$. In addition to being fast to compute, this function makes the algebraic degree large and provides resistance against Gröbner basis attacks. This note also includes a discussion about how to avoid paying high costs when arithmetizing the hash function in a STARK.

*Acknowledgements.* Many of the ideas used in this note came were first discussed in the course of the Rescue-Prime Optimization project [6].

## Specification

### Basic Parameters 

| Parameter | Symbol | Value |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| field modulus | $p$ | $2^{64} - 2^{32} + 1$ |
| number of rounds | $N$ | 7 |
| state size | $m$ | 16 |
| sponge rate | $r$ | 10 |
| sponge capacity | $c$ | 6 |
| digest length | $d$ | 5 |

For the sake of genericity the rest of the note uses the symbol rather than the value.

### S-Box

There are two types of S-boxes. One is the regular forward $\alpha$-th power map already used in Rescue-Prime. The second type is more involved and may be called the split-and-lookup map. Every round consists of one S-box layer; in this layer the first $m/2$ state elements are mapped by the split-and-lookup map and the second $m/2$ state elements are mapped by the forward $\alpha$-th power map.

The split-and-lookup map is defined as follows:

$$ S : \mathbb{F}_p \rightarrow \mathbb{F}_p,  x \mapsto \rho \circ \mu \circ L^4 \circ \mu \circ \sigma  (x) $$

The components are:

 - $\sigma : \mathbb{F}_p \rightarrow \mathbb{F}_p^4, x \mapsto (a, b, c, d)$ where all four outputs are at most 16 bits wide and $x = a + 2^{16} \cdot b + 2^{32} \cdot c + 2^{48} \cdot d$.
 - $\mu : \mathbb{F}_p^4 \rightarrow \mathbb{F}_p^4, (a, b, c, d) \mapsto (a, b, 2^{16}-1 - c, 2^{16}-1 - d)$.
 - $L : \mathbb{F}_ p \rightarrow \mathbb{F}_ p$ is defined only for field elements that are at most 16 bits wide. Identifying this subset of $\mathbb{F}_ p$ with $\mathbb{F}_ {2^{16}+1}$, the lookup table $L$ computes $L : \mathbb{F}_ {2^{16}+1} \rightarrow \mathbb{F}_ {2^{16}+1}, x \mapsto x^3$.
 - $\rho : \mathbb{F}_ p^4 \rightarrow \mathbb{F}_ p$ computes the inverse of $\sigma$.

The inverse of this S-box is $\rho \circ \mu \circ (L^{-1})^4 \circ \mu \circ \sigma$.

One input-output pair is noteworthy $S(-1) = -1$.

### Remaining Specifications

A single round consists of three steps:

 1. A full S-box layer, in which the function $S(x)$ is applied to every element of the state.
 2. Matrix-vector multiplication of the MDS matrix with the state (as the column vector). The MDS matrix is circulant, giving rise to fast matrix-vector products. When $m=16$, the MDS matrix is the one given by the Rescue-Prime Optimized report, namely the circulant matrix whose first row is `[256, 2, 1073741824, 2048, 16777216, 128, 8, 16, 524288, 4194304, 1, 268435456, 1, 1024, 2, 8192]`.
 3. Addition of constants. A preselected random constant is added into every element of the state.

The constants are determined by expanding the ASCII string "`TIP 5`" into $9 m N$ bytes using SHAKE256. Every 9-tuple corresponds to a positive integer by interpreting the first byte as the most significant digit in base 256. Every such integer determines a field element via reduction modulo $p$. The $(mi + j)$ th field element is the constant for the $j$ th state element in the $i$ th round.

The permutation $P$ consists of $N$ rounds. The hash function is obtained by instantiating the sponge construction with the permutation $P$ and truncating the output to length $d$.

## Arithmetization

### Hash Table

Every lookup-input and every lookup-output must be explicitly represented. So $m/2$ field elements being mapped by the split-and-lookup S-box turn into $8 \cdot m/2$ columns. Let `lkin[i]` and `lkout[i]` with `i in {0, ..., m/2-1}` denote these columns. For each pair `(lkin[i], lkout[i])` there are 2 extension columns: one running product `rph[i]` and one formal derivative `fdh[i]`.

### Lookup Table

The lookup table holds all input-output pairs. It is either precomputed or verified with an internal AIR. What is discussed here is the matching part of the lookup argument.

In addition to the input and output columns, there is one column `mul` that represents the number of times the pair in question is looked up. In terms of extension columns, there is one running product column, `rpl`, which accumulates a factor in every row that is involved in at least one lookup, and which remains the same in all other rows. The prover knows whether to apply the update or not, and cannot cheat. Additionally, there is one column `mwfdl` computing a cofactor; a *multiplicity-weighted* variant of the product rule of differentiation is applied to this column in the same rows in which `rpl` accumulates one factor.

### Intuition

Using random weights from the verifier `a, b`, the input and output columns are compressed into one random linear combination. It then suffices to show that the set of random linear combinations used by the Hash Table, is a subset of the random linear combinations in the lookup table.

The Hash Table and Lookup Table both compute a running product of random linear combinations offset by some α:

$$ \texttt{rph}(\alpha) = \prod_i (\texttt{rlc}_i - \alpha)^{m_i} $$

$$ \texttt{rpl}(\alpha) = \prod_i (\texttt{rlc}_i - \alpha) $$

The difference between these two polynomials (in α) is the multiplicities $m_i$ of their roots, which is 1 for the Lookup Table and possible greater than 1 for the Hash Table.
The following Bézout relation argument eliminates these multiplicities, enabling a test for subset relationship by probing a polynomial identity in a random point.

The Hash Table's `fdh` column computes the formal derivative of its running product polynomial:

$$ \texttt{fdh}(\alpha) = \sum_i m_i (\alpha - \texttt{rlc}_i)^{m_i - 1} \prod_{j \neq i} (\alpha - \texttt{rlc}_j)^{m_j} = \frac{d}{d\alpha} \texttt{rph}(\alpha) $$

The Lookup Table's multiplicity-weighted formal derivative column `mwfdl` computes the formal derivative of `rpl` up to multiplicities:

$$ \texttt{mwfdl}(\alpha) = \sum_i m_i \prod_{j \neq i} (\alpha - \texttt{rlc}_j) $$

On the side of the Hash Table, the running product and its formal derivative satisfy the following Bézout relation: `rph(α) * x(α) + fdh(α) * y(α) = g(α)`, where `g(α)` is the greatest common divisor and `x(α)` and `y(α)` are Bézout coefficient polynomials. Then `rph(α) / g(α)` is the square-free polynomial with the same roots as `rph(α)`, and equal to `rpl(α)` of the Lookup Table. Moreover, a similar relationship holds for the formal derivatives: `fdh(α) / g(α) = mwfdl(α)`. By eliminating `g(α)` we get the identity of polynomials `rph(α) * mwfdl(α) = fdh(α) * rpl(α)`. This identity is the cross-table terminal constraint.

The cheating prover who uses an input-output pair not in the lookup table must use a polynomial `rph(α)` with at least one root that `rpl(α)` does not share. As a result, the polynomial identity is not satisfied because this root occurs in the left hand side with multiplicity one greater than in the right hand side. By the Schwarz-Zippel lemma, the probability that the identity holds in the random point `α` is at most $\frac{(1 + m/2) T}{|\mathbb{F}|}$, where $T$ is the padded height of the table.

## Security

### Statistical Differential Attack

The MDS matrix guarantees that in every consecutive pair of rounds, at least $m+1$ S-boxes are differentially active. But in every consecutive pair of rounds, there are only $m$ split-and-lookup maps, so at least one forward $\alpha$-th power map must be differentially active.

Extending this argument to $n$ rounds: in every consecutive tuple of $n$ rounds, at least $nm + \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor$ S-boxes are differentially active and at least $\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor$ of them must be forward $\alpha$-th power maps. The probability that a differential characteristic is satisfied is at most $\left( \frac{\alpha-1}{p} \right)^{\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor}$. For the given concrete parameters this probability is on the order of $2^{-184.245}$.

### Gröbner Basis Attacks

There are $m(N+1)$ wires of which $c$ are set to zero initially and $d$ are given by the digest, so $m(N+1)-c-d$ in total. There are as many equations. Their degrees are

 1. $p-1$ (or close to $p-1$) if it describes a split-and-lookup map;
 2. $\alpha$ if it describes a forward $\alpha$-th power map.

The Macaulay bound exceeds $p$. Therefore it pays to add the field equation $x^p - x$ for every variable $x$. This addition has the effect of restricting the degree to $p-1$.

Macaulay matrix at this degree has $\binom{p-1}{m(N+1)-c-d}$ columns and as many rows. Assuming that the matrix is dense, finding a kernel vector using sparse linear algebra methods takes this number *squared* operations. For the concrete parameters this square is approximately $2^{13696}$.
