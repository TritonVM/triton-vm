**Abstract.**
This note proposes a new arithmetization-oriented hash function. It uses the SHARK design strategy [1] in combination with lookup tables, and is defined over the field with $p=2^{64}-2^{32}+1$ elements. This note also discusses techniques for efficiently arithmetizing the hash function.

## Introduction

In the space of arithmetization-oriented hash function, two design strategies stand out.

 1. The Marvellous design strategy [2], best known for its member Rescue-Prime [3], introduced the idea of alternating S-box layers where even layers compute low-degree permutations in one direction and odd layers compute low-degree permutations in the opposite direction. As a result, a small number of rounds guarantees that the algebraic degree of the cipher is sufficiently high when attacked from any direction. Moreover, in the specific case of Rescue-Prime, two consecutive S-box layers can be folded together into one low-degree arithmetization. This folding technique yields essentially two rounds of the cipher for the price of one cycle in the arithmetic virtual machine. Since the publication of the Marvellous design strategy, there has been very little progress in cryptanalyzing Rescue and Rescue-Prime.

 2. Reinforced Concrete [4] introduced the use of lookup tables in an otherwise arithmetization-oriented cipher. The lookup table can be evaluated efficiently on CPUs as well as proven efficiently in a zero-knowledge or succinctly verifiable proof system using Plookup [5] or techniques derived from there. Moreover, represented as polynomials over a finite field, non-trivial lookup tables have maximal degree. Therefore, the use of lookup tables provides a robust way to resist algebraic attacks including attacks relying on Gröbner bases. The downside of this technique is that the lookup tables cannot be too large; that therefore the field elements must be decomposed into chunks which are then looked up; and that the prover must establish the correct decomposition and recomposition of these chunks. This process leads to an expensive arithmetization and does not generalize well to arbitrary fields.

This note proposes a new hash function. It uses the SHARK design strategy, on which Marvellous is based, of using full S-box layers interleaved with MDS matrices. This strategy ensures resistance against statistical attacks. The S-box is built from a table lookup that computes the cube map in $\mathbb{F}_{2^{16}+1}$. In addition to being fast to compute, this function makes the algebraic degree large and provides resistance against Gröbner basis attacks. This note also includes a discussion about how to avoid paying high costs when arithmetizing the hash function in a STARK.

*Acknowledgements.* Many of the ideas used in this note came were first discussed in the course of the Rescue-Prime Optimization project [6].

## Specification

### Basic Parameters 

| Parameter | Symbol | Value |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| field modulus | $p$ | $2^{64} - 2^{32} + 1$ |
| number of rounds | $N$ | 7 |
| state size | $m$ | 16 |
| sponge rate | $r$ | 10 |
| sponge capacity | $c$ | 6 |
| digest length | $d$ | 5 |

For the sake of genericity the rest of the note uses the symbol rather than the value.

### S-Box

There are two types of S-boxes. One is the regular forward $\alpha$-th power map already used in Rescue-Prime. The second type is more involved and may be called the split-and-lookup map. Every round consists of one S-box layer; in this layer the first $m/2$ state elements are mapped by the split-and-lookup map and the second $m/2$ state elements are mapped by the forward $\alpha$-th power map.

The split-and-lookup map is defined as follows:

$$ S : \mathbb{F}_p \rightarrow \mathbb{F}_p,  x \mapsto \rho \circ \mu \circ L^4 \circ \mu \circ \sigma  (x) $$

The components are:

 - $\sigma : \mathbb{F}_p \rightarrow \mathbb{F}_p^4, x \mapsto (a, b, c, d)$ where all four outputs are at most 16 bits wide and $x = a + 2^{16} \cdot b + 2^{32} \cdot c + 2^{48} \cdot d$.
 - $\mu : \mathbb{F}_p^4 \rightarrow \mathbb{F}_p^4, (a, b, c, d) \mapsto (a, b, 2^{16}-1 - c, 2^{16}-1 - d)$.
 - $L : \mathbb{F}_ p \rightarrow \mathbb{F}_ p$ is defined only for field elements that are at most 16 bits wide. Identifying this subset of $\mathbb{F}_ p$ with $\mathbb{F}_ {2^{16}+1}$, the lookup table $L$ computes $L : \mathbb{F}_ {2^{16}+1} \rightarrow \mathbb{F}_ {2^{16}+1}, x \mapsto x^3$.
 - $\rho : \mathbb{F}_ p^4 \rightarrow \mathbb{F}_ p$ computes the inverse of $\sigma$.

The inverse of this S-box is $\rho \circ \mu \circ (L^{-1})^4 \circ \mu \circ \sigma$.

One input-output pair is noteworthy $S(-1) = -1$.

### Remaining Specifications

A single round consists of three steps:

 1. A full S-box layer, in which the function $S(x)$ is applied to every element of the state.
 2. Matrix-vector multiplication of the MDS matrix with the state (as the column vector). The MDS matrix is circulant, giving rise to fast matrix-vector products. When $m=16$, the MDS matrix is the one given by the Rescue-Prime Optimized report, namely the circulant matrix whose first row is `[256, 2, 1073741824, 2048, 16777216, 128, 8, 16, 524288, 4194304, 1, 268435456, 1, 1024, 2, 8192]`.
 3. Addition of constants. A preselected random constant is added into every element of the state.

The constants are determined by expanding the ASCII string "`TIP 5`" into $9 m N$ bytes using SHAKE256. Every 9-tuple corresponds to a positive integer by interpreting the first byte as the most significant digit in base 256. Every such integer determines a field element via reduction modulo $p$. The $(mi + j)$ th field element is the constant for the $j$ th state element in the $i$ th round.

The permutation $P$ consists of $N$ rounds. The hash function is obtained by instantiating the sponge construction with the permutation $P$ and truncating the output to length $d$.

## Arithmetization

### Hash Table

There are $4m$ base columns.

 - In rows congruent to 0 modulo 4, the base columns represent the sponge state before table lookup.
 - In rows congruent to 1 modulo 4, the base columns represent the coefficients of the first Bézout polynomial.
 - In rows congruent to 2 modulo 4, the base columns represent the sponge state after table lookup. 
 - In rows congruent to 3 modulo 4, the base columns represent the coefficients of the second Bézout polynomial.

In addition to these $4 \times m = 64$ base columns, there are $K$ extension columns:

 - In rows congruent to 0 modulo 4, the extension columns represent the running products of factors $(X - \delta)$, where $\delta$ represents some compressed table-lookup input-output pair.
 - In rows congruent to 1 modulo 4, the extension columns represent the running evaluation of the first Bézout polynomial.
 - In rows congruent to 2 modulo 4, the extension columns represent the formal derivatives of the running products.
 - In rows congruent to 3 modulo 4, the extension columns represent the running evaluation of the second Bézout polynomial.

The number $K$ can be traded off against a higher AIR degree $D$. The following $(K, D)$ pairs are viable trade-offs: $(64, 2), (32, 3), (16, 5), (8,9)$, or more generally any integer pair $(2^k, 2^{6-k}+1)$.

### Lookup Table

The Lookup Table holds two precomputed columns and one extension column. The two precomputed columns contain the input-output pairs for all $2^{16}$ inputs. The extension column contains the running product of $(X - \delta)$ for all selected rows. The prover knows which rows to select. The AIR establishes that the running product was either updated correctly, or not at all.

### Intuition

Let $f(X) = \prod_i (X - \delta_i)^{m_i}$ be the terminal value of the running products, and $f'(X) = \sum_i \prod_{j \neq i} (X - \delta_j)^{m_j}$ its formal derivative. Then there are Bézout coefficient polynomials $a(X)$ and $b(X)$ such that $a(X) \cdot f(X) + b(X) \cdot f'(X) = \gcd(f(X), f'(X)) = \prod_i (X - \delta_i)^{m_i-1}$. Moreover, this greatest common divisor divides $f(X)$ and the quotient $q(X) = \frac{f(X)}{\gcd(f(X),f'(X))} = \prod_i (X - \delta_i)$ has all roots of $f(X)$ but with multiplicity exactly 1. In terms of these symbols, the Bézout relation can be stated as

$$ a(X) \cdot f(X) + b(X) \cdot f'(X) = \frac{f(X)}{q(X)} .$$

The running product of the Lookup Table computes this quotient. The extension columns of the Hash Table supply the remaining columns. A (rather sophisticated but possible) multi-row cross-table terminal constraint probes the polynomial identity $(a(X) \cdot q(X) - 1) \cdot f(X) + b(X) \cdot q(X) \cdot f'(X) = 0$ in a random point $\alpha$ supplied by the verifier via Fiat-Shamir. 

## Performance

## Security

### Statistical Differential Attack

The MDS matrix guarantees that in every consecutive pair of rounds, at least $m+1$ S-boxes are differentially active. But in every consecutive pair of rounds, there are only $m$ split-and-lookup maps, so at least one forward $\alpha$-th power map must be differentially active.

Extending this argument to $n$ rounds: in every consecutive tuple of $n$ rounds, at least $nm + \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor$ S-boxes are differentially active and at least $\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor$ of them must be forward $\alpha$-th power maps. The probability that a differential characteristic is satisfied is at most $\left( \frac{\alpha-1}{p} \right)^{\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor}$. For the given concrete parameters this probability is on the order of $2^{-184.245}$.

### Algebraic Differential Attack

An algebraic description of a differential characteristic has relatively low degree if it renders all split-and-lookup maps differentially inactive. By an analogous argument to the previous, at least $\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor$ differentially active split-and-lookup maps, *in sequence*. Fixing the difference across one split-and-lookup map, for instance due to a lucky guess, still leads to a polynomial description of maximal degree.

### Gröbner Basis Attacks

There are $m(N+1)$ wires of which $c$ are set to zero initially and $d$ are given by the digest, so $m(N+1)-c-d$ in total. There are as many equations. Their degrees are

 1. $p-1$ (or close to $p-1$) if it describes a split-and-lookup map;
 2. $\alpha$ if it describes a forward $\alpha$-th power map.

The Macaulay bound exceeds $p$. Therefore it pays to add the field equation $x^p - x$ for every variable $x$. This addition has the effect of restricting the degree to $p-1$.

Macaulay matrix at this degree has $\binom{p-1}{m(N+1)-c-d}$ columns and as many rows. Assuming that the matrix is dense, finding a kernel vector using sparse linear algebra methods takes this number *squared* operations. For the concrete parameters this square is approximately $2^{13696}$.
